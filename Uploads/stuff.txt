Dear Sir or Maddam, 

I hereby wish to state my interest for a spot in the Baden-Würtemberg program and therefore, I would like explain to you why 
I think your program would be a perfect opportunity for me.

My long term goal is to take on a leading position in an internationally operating company. On my way to 
achie this goal, I have already taken some important steps. After graduating from high school which 
is specialiced on business management and information systems I started an apprenticeship as an IT specialist. 
I completed my apprenticeship successfully ahead of scedule followed by a half-year professional activity as a Software-
Engineer. I continued 
my way with the enrollment in Software-Engineering at the University of Ulm. It would be an honor 
if I could continue my way at SDSU.

Since I was a teenager I feel like living in another country for a longer period and getting to know different cultures. 
Because I have a family with two younger sisters and two older brothers, the money often restriced our wishes. 
Also the school's I have visited didn't offer exchange programs. I had the first international working experience during
my professional time. My company gave me the chance to complete some projects by working
together with the customer in different european countries. This experience made myself very curios about getting to know 
other cultures and to work within an international context.
 Now I earn my own money, have enough time and so I want to 
fulfil myself a big dream.

While I was talking to a workmate and telling him about my future plan, to study in North-America, he
recommended the SDSU. During my research I fell in love with San Diego and the university because it offers courses like 
'Software Engineering' and 'Object-Oriented Programming and Design' in which I want to specialize in. Because of my
apprenticeship I already know in which sector of the huge IT-Branch I want to work and this university offers 
perfekt subjects for my future plans. Furthermore working and studying in another culture will help me to extend my 
intercultural knowledge as well as to improve my language skills. This experience abroad will contribute to achieve 
my future objective, a leading position in an internationally operating company.

Beside the educational quality of the SDSU, I think living in 'America's finest City' is very comfortable. For example the 
sun shines around 330 days a year and it offers lots of outdoor pursuits, in which I'm really interested. If you are 
tired of visiting cities like Los Angeles or Las Vegas, impressive nature like the Grand Canyon, deserts or moutains are not
 too far away.

I would be glad to recieve a new experience and a fantastic new story for my life.
